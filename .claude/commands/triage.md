# Triage Agent Reports

Model tier: **sonnet** — Sonnet 4.6 (1M context) session.

Process all overnight agent reports, all open GitHub PRs, and the Dependabot PR queue. Discovers every report using timestamp-based discovery, checks for agent failures, inventories every open PR, scans open Dependabot PRs for special handling (Rule #72), synthesizes findings, proposes an action plan, implements all fixes, and merges the Dependabot PRs that are safe to auto-merge. Report commit policy depends on repo visibility: public repos keep reports local, private repos commit them as historical artifacts (Rule #70).

## Input

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, process only the specified report path(s). Always include all open GitHub PRs. Otherwise, auto-discover all new/modified reports in `docs/agents/`. If no reports found, no agent failures detected, and no open PRs exist, report "all clear" and **STOP.**

## Step 1: Discovery

Find EVERY report, agent failure, and open GitHub PR. No assumptions about which agents ran, how many reports exist, or how many PRs are open. Report discovery uses file timestamps, not git status (Rule #71).

1. **Timestamp-based scan:**

   a. Check for the `.last-triage` marker:

      ```bash
      ls -la docs/agents/.last-triage 2>/dev/null
      ```

   b. If marker exists -- find reports modified since last triage:

      ```bash
      find docs/agents/ -name "*-report.md" -newer docs/agents/.last-triage
      ```

   c. If NO marker exists (first run) -- process ALL reports:

      ```
      Glob docs/agents/*-report.md
      ```

   d. Full inventory (for cross-reference and completeness):

      ```
      Glob docs/agents/*.md
      ```

2. **Check for agent failures:**

   Scan `logs/` for recent error logs:

   ```bash
   find logs/ -name "*.error.log" -mtime -1 2>/dev/null
   ```

   For each error log modified in the last 24 hours:
   - Read the last 50 lines.
   - Determine if the agent failed (non-zero exit, FATAL, crash).
   - If an agent failed but has no corresponding report in `docs/agents/`,
     flag it: "agent-name FAILED to produce a report -- check `logs/agent-name.error.log`"

3. **Check for all open GitHub PRs:**

   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open \
     --json number,title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,isDraft,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,updatedAt,url
   ```

   For each open PR, capture:
   - Number, title, author, URL.
   - Head branch and base branch.
   - Draft status.
   - Review decision.
   - Merge state.
   - CI/check status summary.
   - Last updated timestamp.

   If `gh pr list` fails, include a GitHub PR discovery failure in the briefing and action plan instead of silently omitting PRs.

4. **Check for open Dependabot PRs (Rule #72):**

   ```bash
   gh pr list --author "app/dependabot" \
     --json number,title,headRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,labels
   ```

   For each PR, classify the update type from the title (e.g., `Bump foo from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4` -> patch; `1.2.x -> 1.3.0` -> minor; `1.x -> 2.0.0` -> major) and the CI status:

   - **patch + CI green** -> ready-to-merge (auto)
   - **minor + CI green** -> ready-to-merge (auto)
   - **major** -> defer, human review required (regardless of CI)
   - **CI red, fix looks obvious** (e.g., snapshot/lockfile drift) -> attempt-fix
   - **CI red, not obvious** -> defer, note in report
   - **Mergeable conflict** -> attempt rebase via `gh pr update-branch`; if still conflicting, defer

5. **Classify files and PRs:**
   - New/modified reports (newer than `.last-triage`): primary triage targets.
   - `shared-context.md`: read for cross-agent intelligence, not a report itself.
   - Unchanged reports (older than `.last-triage`): skip -- already processed.
   - Open PRs: primary triage targets every run, regardless of `.last-triage`.
   - Dependabot PRs: subset of open PRs with special handling in Step 5.

6. **Present discovery results:**

   Agent Failures (if any):

   | Agent | Status | Error Log | Last Line |
   |-------|--------|-----------|-----------|

   Reports to Process:

   | # | Report File | Modified | Size |
   |---|-------------|----------|------|

   Open Pull Requests:

   | # | PR | Title | Branch | Base | Draft | Review | Merge State | Checks | Updated |
   |---|----|-------|--------|------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|---------|

   Dependabot PRs (if any):

   | # | PR | Update Type | CI | Disposition |
   |---|----|----|----|----|

   Total: N reports to process, M agent failures detected, P open PRs found, K Dependabot PRs (auto-merge: A, attempt-fix: F, defer: D).

   Do NOT stop here -- proceed directly to analysis unless there are ZERO reports, ZERO failures, AND ZERO open PRs (in which case report "all clear" and **STOP**).

## Step 2: Analyze

Read-only. Do not modify any files.

1. **Read `shared-context.md`** for cross-agent intelligence and patterns.

2. **Read EVERY report** from the discovery list. Completely. No skimming.

3. **For each report, extract:**
   - Status: GREEN / YELLOW / RED
   - Key findings (bullet points)
   - Metrics (numbers, trends)
   - Action items (what needs fixing)
   - Carried items (persistent across multiple cycles)

4. **Analyze EVERY open PR** from discovery:
   - Determine status: GREEN / YELLOW / RED.
   - RED: failing required checks, merge conflicts, blocked review state, or clear release blocker.
   - YELLOW: draft, pending checks, changes requested, stale/needs owner attention, or unclear readiness.
   - GREEN: ready or no action needed.
   - Extract action items: fix failing CI, resolve conflicts, request/perform review, update stale branch, close superseded PR, or document that no action is needed.
   - Dependabot PRs also receive the Rule #72 disposition for Step 5.
   - Do not modify another PR branch during Step 2; only describe the action needed.

5. **Synthesize across all reports and PRs:**
   - Cross-reference findings (e.g., coverage report flags X needs tests, code quality report flags X has lint issues -- group them).
   - Cross-reference PR findings with agent reports when a report appears to describe the same branch, issue, or failure.
   - Identify patterns (multiple agents flagging the same area).
   - Check shared-context.md recommendations against report findings.

6. **Draft the action plan:**

   Group action items by report and PR. Include ALL items -- fix everything that is in the current working branch and explicitly identify PR-owned work that requires checking out the PR branch or human ownership (Rule #58). For each item: what to do, which files or PR branch, expected outcome.

   ```markdown
   ## Action Plan

   ### From [report-name] (STATUS)
   1. [Action item with specific files and expected outcome]
   2. [Action item...]

   ### From [report-name] (STATUS)
   3. [Action item...]

   ### From PR #[number] (STATUS)
   4. [Action item with PR branch, checks/review state, and expected outcome]

   ### Dependabot PRs (Step 5)
   - Auto-merge: PR #X (patch), PR #Y (minor)
   - Attempt-fix: PR #Z (snapshot drift)
   - Defer: PR #W (major bump)

   Total: N action items across M reports and P open PRs. K Dependabot PRs to process. All in-scope items will be implemented after approval; PR branch actions require explicit approval when they affect a branch other than the current branch.
   ```

7. **Present the briefing and action plan to the user.**

**STOP.** Wait for the user to review and approve the action plan.

## Step 3: Execute

After user approval, implement all in-scope action items.

1. **Implement fixes** following TDD where applicable:
   - Test coverage gaps: write the tests.
   - Code quality issues: fix the code.
   - Security findings: apply the fix.
   - Dependency updates: update and verify.
   - Documentation gaps: update the docs.
   - Configuration issues: fix the config.
   - PR findings on the current branch: fix the code, docs, checks, or metadata directly.
   - PR findings on other branches: check out the PR branch only with explicit approval, then fix and verify there.

2. **Run verification sequentially:**

   ```bash
   $TEST_CMD; $TYPECHECK_CMD; $LINT_CMD
   ```

3. **Run `/simplify`** on all changed files.

4. **Run verification again** (in case `/simplify` introduced changes).

## Step 4: Commit & Push

Commit policy depends on repo visibility (Rule #70). Determine visibility before staging:

```bash
gh repo view --json visibility --jq '.visibility' 2>/dev/null
# PUBLIC -> commit code fixes only (reports gitignored)
# PRIVATE / INTERNAL -> commit code fixes AND reports
# (no remote / gh unavailable) -> treat as PUBLIC (fail-safe)
```

1. **Append triage entry to shared-context.md:**

   ```markdown
   <!-- ENTRY:START agent=triage timestamp=ISO -->
   ## Triage -- YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Reports processed**: N
   - **Open PRs reviewed**: P
   - **Action items resolved**: M
   - **Summary**: [1-line summary of what was fixed]
   **Cross-agent recommendations:**
   - [Agent]: recommendation based on triage findings
   <!-- ENTRY:END -->
   ```

2. **Commit changes:**

   On a **public repo** (or no remote), commit code fixes only:

   ```bash
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -m "fix: resolve agent report findings [triage]"
   ```

   `docs/agents/`, `logs/`, and `scripts/agents/` are gitignored — do NOT `git add` anything in them.

   On a **private repo**, commit code fixes and reports together:

   ```bash
   git add <changed-files> docs/agents/ logs/ scripts/agents/
   git commit -m "fix: resolve agent report findings [triage]"
   ```

3. **Push to remote. Monitor CI:**

   ```bash
   git push
   gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1 \
     --json databaseId,conclusion,status
   ```

4. **If CI fails:** diagnose and fix (same logic as `/fix-ci`, max 3 iterations).

5. **Touch the triage marker** (marks all current reports as processed):

   ```bash
   touch docs/agents/.last-triage
   ```

## Step 5: Process Dependabot PRs

After the triage commit is pushed and green, process the Dependabot PRs identified in Step 1.4 (Rule #72). These are independent commits from the triage code fixes -- handle them last so a flaky dependency PR doesn't block triage.

For each PR by disposition:

1. **auto-merge (patch + CI green, minor + CI green):**

   ```bash
   gh pr merge <num> --squash --auto --delete-branch
   ```

   `--auto` waits for required checks; `--delete-branch` keeps the remote tidy.

2. **attempt-fix (CI red, fix obvious — e.g., snapshot/lockfile drift, generated file out of date):**

   - Check out the PR locally: `gh pr checkout <num>`
   - Regenerate the affected file (run the project's update script, regenerate snapshots, etc.)
   - Push the fix to the PR branch
   - If CI goes green, queue the auto-merge as in step 1
   - One attempt only -- if it doesn't go green, defer

3. **defer (major, non-obvious CI failures, conflicts after rebase):**

   - Add a comment summarizing why it's deferred (e.g., "Major version bump -- requires human review of breaking changes")
   - Leave the PR open
   - Note in the triage report's deferred-PRs section

4. **Mergeable conflicts (before classifying as defer):**

   ```bash
   gh pr update-branch <num>
   ```

   If the rebase resolves the conflict and CI is green, proceed with auto-merge. Otherwise, defer.

Switch back to the triage branch (`main` or wherever the session started) before continuing to the report step.

## Step 6: Report

Generate a triage report at `docs/agents/triage-report.md`:

```markdown
# Triage Report
> Generated on [date] | [N] reports processed | [M] action items | [P] open PRs | [K] Dependabot PRs

## Agent Failures
| Agent | Error | Log File |
|-------|-------|----------|
(or "None -- all agents ran successfully")

## Reports Reviewed
| # | Report | Agent | Status | Action Items |
|---|--------|-------|--------|--------------|

## Pull Requests Reviewed
| # | PR | Branch | Base | Draft | Review | Merge State | Checks | Status | Action Items |
|---|----|--------|------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|

## Overall Status: GREEN / YELLOW / RED

## Action Items Completed
| # | Item | Source Report | Tests Added | Status |
|---|------|--------------|-------------|--------|

## Dependabot PRs
| # | PR | Update Type | Disposition | Notes |
|---|----|----|----|----|
(or "None -- no open Dependabot PRs")

## Verification
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Typecheck clean
- [ ] Lint clean
- [ ] CI green

## Carried Items (if any)
[Items that persist across multiple triage cycles -- track for escalation]
```

Present the report summary to the user.

## Rules

- **Exhaustive discovery.** Use timestamp-based scan for reports (Rule #71) and always query all open GitHub PRs. Never assume how many reports or PRs exist. Present the full count before processing.
- **Report commit policy is visibility-conditional (Rule #70).** Public repos: reports stay local, only code fixes are committed (`docs/agents/`, `logs/`, `scripts/agents/` gitignored). Private repos: reports are committed alongside code fixes as historical artifacts.
- **Process Dependabot PRs (Rule #72).** Triage scans for open Dependabot PRs and merges what it can: patch + minor with green CI auto-merge, majors defer for human review, obvious CI failures get one fix attempt. Dependabot processing happens last so it can't block triage code fixes.
- **Touch `.last-triage` after completion.** This marks all current reports as processed for the next triage run.
- **Check for agent failures.** Scan `logs/` BEFORE analyzing reports. A missing report might mean a failed agent, not "nothing to report."
- **Fix everything (Rule #58).** Categorize findings by severity, but implement 100% of action items. No deferring. No "nothing urgent."
- **Read every report completely.** No skimming, no summaries-of-summaries. Extract ALL action items from every report.
- **shared-context.md integration.** Read before analysis, append triage entry after completion.
- **CI accountability.** Push is not done until CI is green. Max 3 fix iterations.
- **Branch verification before every commit.** Run `git branch --show-current` first (Error #33).
- Run verification commands sequentially, never as parallel Bash calls.
