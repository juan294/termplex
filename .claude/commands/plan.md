Create an implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Process:
1. Read ALL mentioned files completely.
2. Spawn research subagents (Explore) to find relevant code, patterns, and docs.
3. Read everything the subagents identify.
4. Present your understanding with focused questions — only ask what code can't answer.
5. After clarifications, spawn deeper research if needed.
6. Present design options with trade-offs.
7. Propose phase structure, get feedback.
8. Write detailed plan with separate phase files.
9. Use pseudocode notation for changes.
10. Separate automated vs. manual success criteria.
11. Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.
12. Iterate with user until all questions resolved.

Save to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[description].md
Phase files: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[description]-phases/phase-N.md

No unresolved questions in the final plan.
