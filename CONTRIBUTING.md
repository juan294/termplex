## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/termplex.git
   cd termplex
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run tests to verify everything works:

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and write tests.

3. Ensure all checks pass:

   ```bash
   pnpm test          # unit tests
   pnpm run typecheck # type checking
   pnpm run lint      # linting
   pnpm run build     # production build
   ```

4. Open a pull request targeting the `develop` branch.

### Testing Locally

```bash
pnpm run build
chmod +x dist/index.js
./dist/index.js .                    # launch default workspace
./dist/index.js . --layout minimal   # test minimal preset
```
